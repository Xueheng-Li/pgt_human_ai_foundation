## Core Contribution

Studies **value alignment** between humans and robots:
- Operationalized as dynamic goal alignment
- Effects on trust and team performance
- Challenges assumption that alignment always benefits team

---

## Key Concepts

### Value Alignment
- Degree to which robot goals match human goals
- Dynamic: Can change during task
- Observable through behavior

### Trust in HRI
- Trust modulates acceptance
- Affected by alignment perception
- Can be over-trust or under-trust

### Key Finding
> "Prior literature on value alignment makes an inherent assumption that aligning the values of the robot with that of the human benefits the team. This assumption [is challenged]."

---

## Relevance to Project

### Direct Relevance: ***

Relevant for understanding human-AI interaction:
- Alignment ≠ always better outcomes
- Trust formation in strategic settings
- Perception of AI "values"

### Implications for Project
1. AI prosociality ($\gamma$) is a form of value alignment
2. May not always benefit human-AI team
3. Trust dynamics affect cooperation

## Connection to Project

| Project Paper | Connection |
|---------------|------------|
| P1 (Stochastic Stability) | Value alignment affects equilibrium |
| P3 (Attributed Belief EQ) | Humans attribute "values" to AI |
| Pilot Experiment | Measure trust in AI |

---

## Key Results

1. **Alignment not always beneficial** for team performance
2. **Trust calibration** critical for effective collaboration
3. **Transparency** of AI values affects human response
