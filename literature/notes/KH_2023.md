## Core Contribution

Studies how **joint commitment** combined with **reputation** can solve the Prisoner's Dilemma using evolutionary game theory.

Key insight: Public joint commitments create observable signals that interact with reputation to sustain cooperation.

## Key Concepts

### Joint Commitment
- Mutual agreement to cooperate
- Public (observable) vs. private
- Creates expectations and social pressure

### Reputation Mechanism
- Tracks commitment fulfillment
- Affects future partner selection
- Interacts with commitment credibility

### Evolutionary Dynamics
- Strategies evolve based on payoffs
- Commitment-based strategies compete
- Reputation moderates selection pressure

---

## Relevance to Project

### Direct Relevance: ****

Relevant for P3 (Attributed Belief Equilibrium):
- Commitment as belief-creation device
- Observable signals for expectation formation
- Reputation as belief-proxy

### Key Questions for Human-AI
1. Can AI make credible commitments?
2. How do humans form expectations about AI commitments?
3. Does AI "reputation" function like human reputation?

## Connection to Project

| Project Paper | Connection |
|---------------|------------|
| P1 (Stochastic Stability) | Commitment as equilibrium selection |
| P2 (Imitation + Spite) | Commitment violation triggers spite? |
| P3 (Attributed Belief EQ) | Commitment shapes attributed expectations |
| Pilot Experiment | Test AI commitment credibility |

---

## Key Results

1. **Joint commitment alone insufficient** in one-shot PD
2. **Reputation enhances commitment efficacy**
3. **Public commitments** more effective than private
4. **Evolutionary stability** requires both mechanisms
