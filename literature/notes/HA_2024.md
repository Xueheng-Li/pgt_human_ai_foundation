## Core Contribution

Explores how **AI agents can be leveraged to enhance cooperation** in public goods games. Moves beyond traditional regulatory approaches to using **AI as facilitators of cooperation**.

Investigates three AI intervention strategies and their effects on human cooperation.

---

## Key Concepts

### AI as Cooperation Facilitator
- AI agents introduced into human populations
- Not regulators/punishers, but participants
- Various design strategies tested

### Three Intervention Strategies
1. **Unconditional Cooperation**: AI always cooperates
2. **Conditional Cooperation**: AI mimics majority behavior
3. **Strategic Cooperation**: AI optimizes for group welfare

---

## Relevance to Project

### Direct Relevance: *****

This paper is **directly** on our topic:
- Studies AI agents in social dilemmas
- Tests different AI cooperation strategies
- Measures effects on human cooperation

### Key Differences from Our Approach
| Their Approach | Our Approach |
|----------------|--------------|
| AI as cooperation facilitator | AI as strategic agent |
| Focus on intervention design | Focus on equilibrium outcomes |
| Simulation-based | Theory + experiments |
| No psychological games | Indignation mechanism |

---

## Technical Details

### Experimental Setup
- Public Goods Game (PGG)
- Mixed human-AI populations
- AI strategy as treatment variable
- Evolutionary dynamics over rounds

### Key Variables
- AI fraction in population
- AI cooperation strategy
- Human learning/adaptation
- Group formation rules

---

## Key Results

1. **AI cooperation promotes human cooperation** (generally)
2. **Strategy matters**: Unconditional < Conditional < Strategic
3. **Non-linear effects**: Threshold dynamics observed
4. **Sustainability**: Long-term effects depend on AI visibility

## Connection to Project Papers

| Project Paper | Connection |
|---------------|------------|
| P1 (Stochastic Stability) | Tests stability of AI-induced cooperation |
| P2 (Imitation + Spite) | AI as imitation reference |
| P3 (Attributed Belief EQ) | AI strategy as "attributed intention" |
| Pilot Experiment | Similar experimental paradigm |

---

## Implications for Project

### Support for Project Hypotheses
- Confirms AI can affect human cooperation
- Supports existence of threshold effects
- Shows strategy design matters

### Gaps We Address
- No belief-dependent preferences
- No punishment mechanism
- No formal equilibrium analysis
- No stochastic stability characterization

## Comparison with Mei et al. (2024)

| Aspect | Mei et al. | Hintze & Adami |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Focus | AI behavior testing | AI intervention design |
| AI type | LLM (GPT-4) | Programmed agents |
| Human role | Evaluate AI | Respond to AI |
| Key finding | AI more prosocial | AI promotes cooperation |

Both support our premise that AI prosociality affects human behavior.

## Quotes

> "The tragedy of the commons illustrates a fundamental social dilemma where individual rational actions lead to collectively undesired outcomes."

> "We explore how artificial intelligence (AI) agents can be leveraged to enhance cooperation in public goods games."

## Methodological Notes

### Applicable to Our Pilot
- PGG paradigm appropriate
- AI strategy variation as treatment
- Need to add punishment option
- Need to measure belief attribution

### Sample Size Considerations
- Their simulations: Large agent populations
- Our experiments: Need human subjects
- Power analysis required for threshold detection
