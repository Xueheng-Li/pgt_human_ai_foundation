## Core Contribution

Presents a **two-stage game model** combining:
1. **Commitment** mechanism
2. **Optional participation** (loner option)

Studies evolution of commitment-based behaviors when players can abstain.

---

## Key Concepts

### Two-Stage Model
1. **Stage 1**: Commitment declaration (commit or not)
2. **Stage 2**: Action choice (C, D, or abstain)

### Optional Participation
- Players can choose not to participate
- Loners get fixed payoff
- Avoids exploitation by defectors

### Commitment Types
- Unconditional commitment
- Conditional commitment
- No commitment

---

## Relevance to Project

### Direct Relevance: ***

Relevant for experimental design:
- Commitment stage in human-AI games
- Abstention as experimental option
- Two-stage structure for belief elicitation

## Connection to Project

| Project Paper | Connection |
|---------------|------------|
| P3 (Attributed Belief EQ) | Commitment as belief signal |
| Pilot Experiment | Two-stage experimental design |

---

## Key Results

1. **Commitment + abstention** promotes cooperation
2. **Stage order matters**: Commitment before action
3. **Voluntary participation** prevents defector dominance
