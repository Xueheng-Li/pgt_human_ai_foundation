## Core Contribution

Investigates how a **committed minority** (zealots who always cooperate) can drive widespread cooperation in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. Identifies **critical mass threshold** for cooperation to spread.

---

## Key Concepts

### Committed Minority / Zealots
- Agents with fixed cooperative strategy
- Never change strategy regardless of payoffs
- Analogous to AI with fixed prosociality $\gamma$

### Critical Mass Effect
- Below threshold: Cooperation fails to spread
- Above threshold: Cooperation becomes dominant
- Non-linear transition (phase transition)

---

## Relevance to Project

### Direct Relevance: *****

This paper directly addresses P1's central question:
- What fraction of AI (α*) is needed for cooperation?
- Zealot analysis maps to fixed-strategy AI
- Critical mass methodology applicable

### Key Mapping to Project

| Paper Concept | Project Analog |
|---------------|----------------|
| Zealots | AI agents with fixed $\gamma$ |
| Committed fraction | $(1-\alpha)$ AI share |
| Critical mass | Threshold $\alpha^*$ |
| IPD | Human interactions in PGG |

---

## Technical Details

### Model Setup
- Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma
- Mixed population: adaptive + committed agents
- Adaptive agents use strategy updating rules
- Committed agents never update

### Key Results
- Critical mass depends on:
  - Game payoff structure (T, R, P, S)
  - Network topology
  - Updating rule (imitation vs. best response)
- Threshold typically 20-40% depending on conditions

---

## Key Results

1. **Critical mass exists**: Below threshold, cooperation collapses
2. **Network effects matter**: Scale-free networks lower threshold
3. **Interaction structure**: Clustering affects spread dynamics
4. **Repeated interactions**: Memory and reciprocity modify threshold

## Connection to Project Papers

| Project Paper | Connection |
|---------------|------------|
| P1 (Stochastic Stability) | Critical mass $\alpha^*$ derivation |
| P2 (Imitation + Spite) | Zealots as spite-resistant |
| P3 (Attributed Belief EQ) | Zealot beliefs are "design parameters" |
| Pilot Experiment | Test H1: threshold hypothesis |

---

## Implications for AI Design

### Design Question
If AI acts as "committed cooperators":
- What fraction needed to sustain human cooperation?
- Does this depend on AI being recognized as AI?
- How does indignation modify the threshold?

### Testable Predictions
1. Higher AI cooperation → higher human cooperation (up to threshold)
2. Above threshold: qualitative shift in dynamics
3. Network structure (who interacts with AI) matters

---

## Mathematical Framework

### Critical Mass Condition
Let $z$ = fraction of committed cooperators.

Cooperation stable if:
$$z > z^* = f(\text{payoffs}, \text{network}, \text{update rule})$$

For IPD with imitation on regular network:
$$z^* \approx \frac{T - R}{T - P}$$

### Extension Needed
For psychological games with indignation:
$$z^* = f(\text{payoffs}, \text{network}, \beta, \text{belief structure})$$
