## Core Contribution

Studies **reinforcement learning algorithms** in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma:
- Multi-armed bandits
- Contextual bandits
- Full RL agents

Goal: Mimic human behavior patterns in IPD.

---

## Key Concepts

### Spectrum of RL Agents
1. **Multi-armed bandits**: No context, pure exploration/exploitation
2. **Contextual bandits**: Use opponent's last action
3. **Full RL**: Model full history and state

### Human Behavior Mimicry
- Calibrate to human experimental data
- Match cooperation rates
- Reproduce reciprocity patterns

### Tournament Evaluation
- Multiple agent types compete
- Round-robin tournament
- Evolutionary fitness comparison

---

## Relevance to Project

### Direct Relevance: ***

Provides AI behavior models for P2:
- Different AI "types" with different learning rules
- Imitation dynamics with AI reference
- Behavioral calibration methodology

### Key Insight
RL agents can be designed to mimic human behavior → useful for creating "human-like" AI benchmarks.

## Key Results

1. **Contextual bandits** best mimic human behavior
2. **Cooperation emerges** in repeated interactions
3. **Strategy heterogeneity** affects outcomes
