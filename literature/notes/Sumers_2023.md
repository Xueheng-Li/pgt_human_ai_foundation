## Core Contribution

Proposes a **cognitive science-inspired framework** for understanding and designing LLM-based agents:
- Draws from symbolic AI and cognitive science
- Systematic organization of language agents
- Guides future development

---

## Key Concepts

### Cognitive Architecture
Structured framework for agent capabilities:
1. **Memory**: Working, episodic, semantic
2. **Reasoning**: Planning, problem-solving
3. **Learning**: In-context, fine-tuning
4. **Action**: Tool use, environment interaction

### Language Agent
- LLM as core reasoning engine
- Augmented with external resources
- Control flows (prompting, chaining)

---

## Relevance to Project

### Direct Relevance: ***

Provides framework for thinking about AI agent design:
- What cognitive capabilities does AI need for games?
- How to implement belief-like representations?
- Design choices for AI prosociality

### Implications for P3
If LLM agents have "cognitive architecture," can they have:
- Beliefs about human expectations?
- Second-order beliefs?
- Theory of Mind?

## Connection to Project

| Project Paper | Connection |
|---------------|------------|
| P3 (Attributed Belief EQ) | What "beliefs" can AI have? |
| Pilot Experiment | AI agent design choices |

---

## Key Framework

### Memory Types
- **Working memory**: Current context
- **Episodic memory**: Past interactions
- **Semantic memory**: World knowledge

### For Game-Playing AI
- Need: Memory of partner's past actions
- Need: "Model" of partner's strategy
- Optional: Explicit ToM module
