## All 5 Concerns ADDRESSED

| Concern | Status | Evidence |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Extended existence proof for behavioral attribution | ✓ | Proof Step 2 handles both cases; OA.1.3 complete treatment |
| Continuity condition on g specified | ✓ | A2-beh requires strategy continuity |
| Fixed-point argument extended | ✓ | Step 3 verifies Kakutani conditions for both cases |
| Trust game attribution type clarified | ✓ | Remark 4.2 + Remark 4.3 (x vs x_A distinction) |
| Simultaneity concern addressed | ✓ | Own-strategy independence breaks feedback loop |

## Approach Taken
Paper provides extended existence proof covering both exogenous (A2) and behavioral (A2-beh) attribution, while noting applications use exogenous case.
