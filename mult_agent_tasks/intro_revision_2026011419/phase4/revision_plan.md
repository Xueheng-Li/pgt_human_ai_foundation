## Priority 1: Must Fix

### 1.1 Clarity Issues (from Academic Review)

| # | Issue | Location | Recommended Fix |
|---|-------|----------|-----------------|
| 1.1.1 | "Dual psychological asymmetry" undefined | Para 1 | Add explicit definition: "Two asymmetries characterize human-AI interaction: humans attribute beliefs to AI (attribution), yet experience weaker emotional responses toward AI (attenuation)." |
| 1.1.2 | Attribution function lacks economic intuition | Para 3 (Lines 13-14) | Add concrete example: "A chatbot designed to express concern ('I understand your frustration') generates higher attributed expectations than one providing neutral information." |
| 1.1.3 | RAE vs. zero-anthropomorphism distinction buried | Para on nesting (Lines 23-24) | Elevate to standalone sentence with clear contrast: zero-anthropomorphism is a parameter value; RAE is an equilibrium concept requiring fixed-point consistency. |
| 1.1.4 | Phantom expectations introduced too late | Para 5 (welfare section) | Move introduction to attribution-attenuation paragraph, as it directly follows from the structure. |
| 1.1.5 | Overloaded opening paragraph | Para 1 (Lines 7-8) | Separate problem statement from emotional taxonomy. Lead with core asymmetry, then introduce guilt/reciprocity/indignation as examples. |

### 1.2 Content Issues (from Style Review)

| # | Issue | Location | Recommended Fix |
|---|-------|----------|-----------------|
| 1.2.1 | Forbidden word: "substantial" | Line 9 | Delete "The magnitude is substantial:" - quantification ("twice the rate") speaks for itself |
| 1.2.2 | Forbidden word: "tractable" | Line 21 | Delete entire sentence: "This existence result establishes ABE as a tractable framework..." |
| 1.2.3 | Redundant sentence | Line 23 | Delete: "These reductions establish ABE as a proper generalization of existing theory." |
| 1.2.4 | Redundant explanation | Lines 23-24 (end) | Delete: "These are distinct: zero-anthropomorphism describes attribution at a parameter value; rational attribution requires a fixed-point condition." (If 1.1.3 is implemented properly) |

### 1.3 Precision Issues (from Academic Review)

| # | Issue | Location | Recommended Fix |
|---|-------|----------|-----------------|
| 1.3.1 | Application predictions lack quantitative specificity | Para 4 (applications) | Sharpen at least one prediction with expected magnitude or testable condition. E.g., "returns to AI trustees should increase with anthropomorphism measures, holding AI behavior constant" |
| 1.3.2 | Existing theory critique too strong | Line 8 | Reframe: "existing frameworks lack tools to analyze how humans form beliefs about AI mental states" rather than "cannot accommodate" |

---

## Priority 2: Should Fix

### 2.1 Style Improvements (from Style Review)

| # | Issue | Location | Recommended Fix |
|---|-------|----------|-----------------|
| 2.1.1 | Verbose: "belief-dependent emotions" re-explained | Lines 7-8 | Tighten to: "Humans experience guilt from disappointing expectations, reciprocity from perceived intentions, indignation from violated trust." (Cut 3 words) |
| 2.1.2 | Verbose: "psychological payoffs from beliefs about beliefs" | Lines 11-12 | Tighten to: "ABE extends psychological game theory to games mixing belief-dependent humans with programmed AI." (Cut 10 words) |
| 2.1.3 | 40-word sentence on attribution function | Lines 13-14 | Tighten to: "The attribution function maps three inputs to attributed expectations: AI design parameters (prosociality), observable signals (interface, behavior), and individual anthropomorphism." (29 words) |
| 2.1.4 | Verbose regulation sentence | Line 31 | Shorten to: "This divergence justifies transparency regulation." (5 words) |

### 2.2 Paragraph Endings (from Style Review)

| # | Issue | Location | Recommended Fix |
|---|-------|----------|-----------------|
| 2.2.1 | Weak ending: "purely human interaction" | Line 12 (Para 3 end) | Change to: "mirroring genuine human-to-human guilt" |
| 2.2.2 | Weak ending: "given AI characteristics" | Line 14 (Para 4 end) | End at "projects" - delete "given AI characteristics" |

### 2.3 Clarity Improvements (from Academic Review)

| # | Issue | Location | Recommended Fix |
|---|-------|----------|-----------------|
| 2.3.1 | Design principles paragraph too dense | Para 5 (welfare) | Break into sub-paragraphs or streamline to 1-2 key insights |
| 2.3.2 | Mind perception paragraph tangential | Para on agency/experience | Consider moving to footnote or integrate with attribution function description |
| 2.3.3 | Terminology: guilt/betrayal/expectation violation used interchangeably | Throughout | Add clarifying phrase on their relationship |

---

## Priority 3: Consider

### 3.1 Optional Enhancements (from Academic Review)

| # | Enhancement | Rationale |
|---|-------------|-----------|
| 3.1.1 | Add 1-2 more empirical magnitudes | Anchor theory empirically; particularly on anthropomorphism effects |
| 3.1.2 | Condense outline section | Currently standard but adds little value; could be single sentence |
| 3.1.3 | Distinguish ABE from Bayesian games more explicitly | One sentence stating what ABE captures that Bayesian games cannot |

### 3.2 Optional Enhancements (from Style Review)

| # | Enhancement | Rationale |
|---|-------------|-----------|
| 3.2.1 | Specify cooperation threshold numerically | Line 25 - if available from theory |
| 3.2.2 | Consolidate two-benchmark explanation | Make structure clearer |

### 3.3 Minor Alignment Recommendations (from Alignment Review)

| # | Enhancement | Rationale |
|---|-------------|-----------|
| 3.3.1 | Add "(Definition 10)" after RAE | Cross-reference clarity |
| 3.3.2 | Make agency-experience distinction more explicit | Strengthen link between attribution and attenuation |

## Implementation Order

**Phase 4A: Content Fixes (Priority 1)**
1. Define "dual psychological asymmetry" explicitly (1.1.1)
2. Add attribution function example (1.1.2)
3. Clarify RAE vs. zero-anthropomorphism (1.1.3)
4. Move phantom expectations earlier (1.1.4)
5. Restructure opening paragraph (1.1.5)
6. Delete forbidden words and redundant sentences (1.2.1-1.2.4)
7. Sharpen application prediction (1.3.1)
8. Soften existing theory critique (1.3.2)

**Phase 4B: Style Polish (Priority 2)**
1. Apply all word-count reductions (2.1.1-2.1.4)
2. Strengthen paragraph endings (2.2.1-2.2.2)
3. Address density in welfare paragraph (2.3.1)

**Phase 4C: Optional Enhancements (Priority 3)**
- Consider based on word count budget and reviewer feedback
