# Best Practices for Economics Theory Paper Introductions

## Executive Summary

This document synthesizes research on how top economics theory papers structure their introductions, with particular focus on notation usage. The key finding is that **leading theory papers minimize mathematical notation in introductions**, relying instead on verbal descriptions, economic intuition, and informal previews of results. Formal notation is reserved for the model section.

## 1. The Introduction Formula (Keith Head / James Brander)

The most widely-cited framework for economics paper introductions comes from Keith Head (UBC), based on Jim Brander's guidance. The formula has five components:

### 1.1 Hook (Paragraph 1)
Attract reader interest by establishing topic importance:
- **Y matters**: When Y changes, people are helped or hurt
- **Y is puzzling**: It defies easy explanation
- **Y is controversial**: Experts disagree
- **Y is big or common**: Significant scope

**Avoid**:
- "Bait and switch": Promising something interesting but delivering something else
- "All my friends are doing it": Citing only that others have written on the topic

### 1.2 Research Question (Paragraphs 2-3)
State what the paper actually does:
- Should be understandable from the hook alone (no prior literature knowledge needed)
- Include the sentence: "This paper addresses the question..."
- The question should promise a satisfying answer by paper's end

### 1.3 Antecedents (Paragraphs 3-4)
Identify critical prior work:
- Only discuss papers essential to the intellectual narrative
- Give credit but establish that prior work is incomplete
- Avoid insulting prior authors

### 1.4 Value Added (Paragraphs 4-5)
Describe approximately **3 contributions**:
- This is the most important paragraph for convincing referees
- Contributions should make sense only in light of prior work
- May be intertwined with antecedents

### 1.5 Roadmap (Final paragraph)
Outline paper organization:
- Customize to your specific project
- Mention pivotal "landmarks" (problems, solutions, results)
- Keep short---readers are eager to proceed

## 2. Notation in Introductions: Best Practices

### 2.1 The Consensus: Minimal Notation

From William Thomson's "Young Person's Guide to Writing Economic Theory" (JEL 1999) and John Cochrane's writing guide:

**General Principle**: Introductions should be accessible to non-specialists. Mathematical notation creates barriers to understanding and signals that the paper is narrowly technical.

### 2.2 Specific Guidelines

| Practice | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| Equations | Avoid in introduction; preview results verbally |
| Notation | Introduce only if absolutely essential; define immediately |
| Symbols | Use words instead (e.g., "player's utility" not "$u_i$") |
| Formal definitions | Reserve for model section |
| Greek letters | Avoid until necessary |

### 2.3 How to Preview Results Without Equations

**Instead of**:
> "We prove that $u_i(\alpha, \beta_i^1, \beta_{-i}^1, \beta_i^2)$ is continuous in the product topology..."

**Write**:
> "We establish existence of equilibrium by showing that players' utilities depend continuously on the entire belief hierarchy, which allows standard fixed-point arguments to apply."

### 2.4 Thomson's Key Insight

From "Young Person's Guide":
> "The introduction should be readable by someone who knows only the general area of economics to which the paper belongs. It should not require knowledge of the specific literature."

This means avoiding:
- Specialized notation
- Technical assumptions stated formally
- References to specific theorems by number
- Conditions named by letters (e.g., "Condition A4")

## 3. Structure and Length

### 3.1 Optimal Length

| Source | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|
| Cochrane | 3 pages maximum |
| Head/Brander | 5-7 paragraphs total |
| Econometrica practice | 4-6 pages typical for theory papers |

### 3.2 Paragraph Structure

**Typical flow** (5-7 paragraphs):
1. Hook: Why the topic matters
2. Gap/Question: What's missing or puzzling
3. This paper: What we do
4. Antecedents: Key prior work
5. Contributions: Our value-added (may take 2 paragraphs)
6. Roadmap: Paper organization

### 3.3 What NOT to Include in Introduction

- Detailed model setup
- Formal definitions of equilibrium concepts
- Mathematical proofs or proof sketches
- Comprehensive literature review
- Discussion of extensions (save for later)

## 4. Psychological Game Theory Papers: Case Studies

### 4.1 Geanakoplos, Pearce, and Stacchetti (1989) - GEB

The foundational psychological games paper follows a notable pattern:
- **Introduction**: Motivates with examples (surprise, disappointment)
- **Notation**: Minimal in introduction; formal framework introduced in Section 2
- **Results preview**: Described verbally in terms of economic intuition
- **Length**: Approximately 4 pages of introduction

### 4.2 Rabin (1993) - AER "Incorporating Fairness"

- Opens with economic phenomena (ultimatum game rejections)
- Introduces fairness concept verbally before formalization
- Mathematical framework appears in Section II
- Introduction: ~5 pages, primarily verbal

### 4.3 Battigalli and Dufwenberg (2022) - JEL Survey

- Extensive verbal motivation of belief-dependent utilities
- Examples precede formal definitions
- Clear separation between intuition (introduction) and formalization (later sections)

### 4.4 Common Patterns in PGT Introductions

1. **Start with behavioral phenomena**: Real-world examples that standard theory cannot explain
2. **Verbal description of innovation**: "Utilities may depend on beliefs" before any notation
3. **Defer formalization**: Technical framework comes after motivation
4. **Economic intuition first**: Results described in terms of mechanisms, not theorems

---

## 5. Previewing Formal Results Without Equations

### 5.1 Techniques for Verbal Result Previews

**Existence results**:
> "We show that equilibrium exists under general conditions on the underlying game."

**Characterization results**:
> "The equilibrium exhibits a cutoff structure: players cooperate if and only if their beliefs about others' intentions exceed a threshold."

**Comparative statics**:
> "Greater transparency about intentions increases cooperation, but the effect depends on whether guilt or anger dominates player motivations."

### 5.2 What to Include

- Economic interpretation of results
- Qualitative predictions
- Intuition for why results hold
- Connection to empirical observations

### 5.3 What to Defer

- Formal conditions for results
- Precise mathematical statements
- Technical assumptions
- Proofs or proof strategies (except briefly in roadmap)

## 6. Econometrica Style Guidelines (Relevant Points)

From official Econometrica instructions:

1. **Avoid starting sentences with lowercase mathematical symbols**
2. **Only number equations referenced later**
3. **Use Arabic numerals for equations, Roman for tables**
4. **In formal definitions, italicize only the term being defined**

These suggest even the journal expects minimal notation until necessary.

---

## 7. Actionable Recommendations for Revision

For a paper with too much mathematical notation in the introduction:

### 7.1 Immediate Changes

1. **Remove all equations** from the introduction
2. **Replace notation with words**: "$\beta_i^1$" becomes "first-order beliefs"
3. **Move formal definitions** to the model section
4. **Describe results verbally**: Focus on economic implications

### 7.2 Structure Check

Verify your introduction has:
- [ ] Clear hook establishing importance (paragraph 1)
- [ ] Research question stated plainly (paragraphs 2-3)
- [ ] Key antecedents with gaps identified (paragraphs 3-4)
- [ ] Three contributions clearly stated (paragraphs 4-5)
- [ ] Brief roadmap (final paragraph)

### 7.3 Notation Audit

For each piece of notation in the introduction, ask:
- Can this be expressed in words?
- Does the reader need this symbol to understand the point?
- Can I defer this to the model section?

If any answer is "yes, yes, no"---keep the notation. Otherwise, remove it.

### 7.4 Test for Accessibility

A non-specialist economist should be able to read your introduction and understand:
- Why the topic matters
- What question you're asking
- What your main contribution is
- How your paper relates to prior work

They should NOT need to understand:
- Your specific notation
- Technical details of your equilibrium concept
- Mathematical conditions for your results
