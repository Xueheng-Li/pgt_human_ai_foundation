# Exemplar Analysis: Introduction Styles from Key PGT Papers

## Key Findings from Literature Analysis

### Battigalli & Dufwenberg (2009) - "Dynamic Psychological Games"
- **Opening Strategy**: Starts with limitation of existing framework (GPS 1989)
- **Innovation Framing**: "More general framework" - uses comparative language
- **Structure Pattern**: Problem → Solution → Technical innovations → Examples
- **Verbal Style**: Explains concepts before formalizing them
- **Result Preview**: States main contribution clearly WITHOUT equations in intro

### Geanakoplos, Pearce & Stacchetti (1989) - "Psychological Games"
- **Opening**: Defines central mechanism in plain language
- **Key Quote Pattern**: "In psychological games the payoff depends not only on what every player does but also on what he thinks every player believes..."
- **Equilibrium Concepts**: Introduces solution concepts verbally before mathematical treatment
- **Structure**: Definition → Problem → Solution concept → Properties

## Optimal Introduction Structure (Econometrica/JET Style)

1. **Motivation (1-2 paragraphs)**: General problem, why it matters, prior limitations
2. **Empirical Regularities (1-2 paragraphs)**: Documented facts, cross-cultural evidence
3. **Core Innovation (1-2 paragraphs)**: What we propose, key insight VERBALIZED, NO EQUATIONS
4. **Results Preview (2-3 paragraphs)**: Five clusters, 2-3 sentences each, verbal only
5. **Literature Review (2-3 paragraphs)**: Four literatures, comparative positioning
6. **Outline (1 paragraph)**: Section organization

## Critical Differences: Current Introduction

### Strengths (Aligned with Exemplars)
- Clear problem statement (dual asymmetry)
- Strong empirical grounding (anthropomorphism, attenuation)
- Five-cluster result structure
- Explicit literature positioning
- Good outline section

### Areas for Revision
1. **NOTATION REMOVAL**: Current equation $\tilde{h}_i^{(2,j)} = \phi_i(\theta_j, x_j, \omega_i)$ should be verbalized
2. **ATTENUATION PARAMETERS**: Use words not $\lambda^{GUILT}, \lambda^{IND}$
3. **PSYCHOLOGICAL PAYOFF FORMALIZATION**: Too technical for introduction

## Recommended Changes

### Priority 1 (Must Do)
- Remove all mathematical notation from Introduction
- Tighten attribution mechanism explanation to 1 paragraph
- Verify all proposition numbers match main body

### Priority 2 (Should Do)
- Trim literature review by ~150 words
- Strengthen policy/design implications in results preview
- Add explicit statement of gaps filled

### Priority 3 (Could Do)
- Reorganize results clusters for emphasis
- Add more cross-cultural examples
- Include forward reference to evolutionary context

## Optimal Length
- Current: ~2,800 words (appropriate)
- Target: ~2,500 words after revision
- Savings: Remove equations (~200), consolidate literature (~150), tighten results (~100)

## Goyal-Style Principles
1. **Economy**: "We show" not "we demonstrate the existence of"
2. **Specificity**: "97 effect sizes" and "twice the rate" are good
3. **Directness**: Active voice, findings first
4. **Emphatic Endings**: Check last sentence of each paragraph
