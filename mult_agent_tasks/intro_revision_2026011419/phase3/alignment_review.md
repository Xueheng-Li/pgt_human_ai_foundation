## DETAILED VERIFICATION

### Major Results Previewed
- **Theorem 1** (Existence): ✓ Correctly previewed
- **Propositions 1-3** (Nesting): ✓ PGT, Nash, Bayes-Nash reductions accurate
- **Proposition 4** (Multiplicity): ✓ Attribution-dependent multiplicity correct
- **Propositions 5-7** (Applications): ✓ Trust, public goods, coordination accurate
- **Propositions 8-9** (Welfare): ✓ Anthropomorphism effects correctly stated
- **Propositions 10, 10'** (Optimal Design): ✓ All three cases covered
- **Corollaries 2-3** (Welfare Measures): ✓ Agreement/divergence conditions correct

### Key Concepts Verified
- **ABE**: Dual consistency requirement correctly explained
- **RAE vs. Zero-Anthropomorphism**: Distinction correctly articulated
- **Phantom Expectations**: Concept accurately introduced
- **Attribution Function**: Three inputs correctly identified
- **Attenuation**: Range and interpretation accurate

### Terminology Consistency
10/10 key terms match between intro and main body:
- ABE, RAE, phantom expectations, attribution function, attenuation
- Psychological Nash Equilibrium, materialist AI, prosocial AI, zero-anthropomorphism benchmark

---

## MINOR RECOMMENDATIONS (Non-Critical)

1. Consider adding parenthetical "(Definition 10)" after "Rational Attribution Equilibrium"
2. Could strengthen Corollaries 2-3 reference with explicit numbers
3. Agency-experience distinction could be more explicit in linking attribution and attenuation

---

## CONCLUSION

**Recommendation**: APPROVED for integration. The draft successfully previews all main body contributions while maintaining narrative coherence and conceptual precision.
