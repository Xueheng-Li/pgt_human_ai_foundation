## Depth Preservation Confirmation

### All Preserved:
- **Definition 10 (ABE):** Complete with four conditions
- **Theorem 1 (Existence):** Full proof sketch with Kakutani argument
- **Proposition 5 (Reduction to PGT):** Statement and proof reference
- **Proposition 6 (Reduction to Nash):** Statement and proof reference
- **Proposition 7 (Rational Attribution):** Full statement
- **Definition 11 (RAE):** Complete with fixed-point condition
- **Proposition 8 (RAE Existence):** Both conditions preserved
- **Proposition 9 (Multiplicity):** Three conditions, remarks on feed-forward structure
- **All application propositions:** Trust (Prop 3), Public Goods (Prop 4), Coordination (Prop 5)
- **All three illustrative examples:** Trust game, public goods, coordination

### Economic Insights Preserved:
- Feed-forward chain mechanism ($\phi \to \tilde{h}^{(2)} \to U^H \to s^*$)
- Attribution as equilibrium selection device
- Interface design affecting equilibrium with fixed material payoffs
- Asymmetric welfare implications (prosocial vs. materialist AI)
- Attenuation's dual role
- AI as constructed focal point

## Notes

- sec_equilibrium exceeded reduction target (achieved 27% vs. 20% target)
- sec_applications achieved minimal reduction (1% vs. 10% target) because the section was already relatively tight; strategy document correctly marked it as "Low Priority"
- Combined reduction of ~794 words contributes to overall paper tightening goal
- All propositions, definitions, and economic mechanisms preserved intact
