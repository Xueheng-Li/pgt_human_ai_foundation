## Changes Made

### sec_welfare.tex

1. **Asymmetric Welfare Implications (Lines 89-99)**: Condensed from ~280 words to ~80 words
   - Cut verbose restatement of Proposition content
   - Preserved core asymmetry insight: prosocial AI = directional alignment; materialist AI = phantom expectations
   - Kept alignment problem statement

2. **Attenuation as Welfare Buffer (Lines 196-207)**: Cut Remark 13 and condensed prose
   - Deleted redundant remark (welfare role already explained)
   - Reduced to single concise paragraph (~40 words saved)

3. **Corollary Proofs (Lines 153-179)**: Shortened both proof sketches
   - Agreement corollary proof: cut from ~80 to ~30 words
   - Divergence corollary proof: cut from ~100 to ~40 words
   - Both proofs preserve logical structure

### sec_conclusion.tex

1. **Summary of Contributions (Lines 5-17)**: Cut from ~400 to ~200 words
   - Removed Kakutani fixed-point technical details
   - Removed detailed Battigalli reference
   - Removed verbose restatement of nesting results
   - Removed extended applications discussion (trust, public goods, coordination)
   - Removed detailed welfare asymmetry restatement
   - Preserved: feed-forward chain, attribution-dependent multiplicity, key insight

2. **Empirical Agenda (Lines 31-38)**: Cut from ~250 to ~80 words
   - Cross-referenced Section 2.6.1 instead of restating
   - Kept central prediction ($\beta_3 > 0$)
   - Kept key challenges list
   - Removed: three comparative statics, detailed experimental design, measurement challenges paragraph

3. **Implications for AI Development (Lines 40-46)**: Cut from ~230 to ~70 words
   - Removed repetition from Applications and Welfare sections
   - Kept: core design failure identification, regulation implication
   - Kept: cross-cultural variation point
   - Removed: verbose interface design explanation

4. **Future Directions (Lines 48-55)**: Cut from ~150 to ~60 words
   - Condensed three paragraphs to one
   - Preserved: evolutionary extension, mechanism design connection, application domains

## Notes

- Welfare section cuts focused on redundant explanations of propositions (content already in proposition statements and proofs)
- Conclusion cuts targeted repetition of earlier sections; synthesizes rather than repeats
- All propositions, corollaries, and examples remain intact
- Cross-references preserved for readers seeking detail
- Economic significance and policy implications retained throughout
