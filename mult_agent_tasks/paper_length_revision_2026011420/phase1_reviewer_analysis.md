# Phase 1: Reviewer Analysis - Paper Length Concerns

**Generated:** January 14, 2026

## Verbatim Quotes About Length/Verbosity

### Econometrica Reviewer

> "At approximately 55 pages including appendix, the paper is long. The proofs are carefully written but some (e.g., Theorem 1) could be shortened by relegating topology details to a technical appendix. The framework section (Section 2) is thorough but could be tightened; the mind perception psychology section (2.6.2) is useful but perhaps excessive for Econometrica."

> "Consider whether the paper's length can be reduced without losing essential content"

> "The paper should either streamline this section [Section 2.6.1 on empirical implementation] (if the goal is to demonstrate testability in principle) or engage more seriously with identification challenges"

> "Contribution vs. apparatus ratio: The framework is elaborate (attribution functions, attenuation factors, dual consistency conditions), but the applications yield relatively modest new insights."

### JET Reviewer

> "The paper is long (55+ pages with appendix); some proofs could be shortened without loss"

> "The paper should either (a) provide conditions under which different attribution specifications generate observationally distinct predictions, or (b) explicitly characterize the class of attribution functions for which the main results hold. The current treatment switches between general phi_i and the linear specification without clear guidance on which results depend on which."

### GEB Reviewer

> "The paper is long (approximately 50 pages with appendix). Consider moving some technical material (e.g., detailed proof of Theorem 1, the attribution function specification discussion) to a supplementary appendix to improve readability."

> "Paper length could be reduced" [listed as explicit weakness]

## Specific Sections/Items Flagged for Cutting or Tightening

### High Priority (Multiple Reviewers)

1. **Theorem 1 Proof (Existence)**
   - Econometrica: "could be shortened by relegating topology details to a technical appendix"
   - GEB: "detailed proof of Theorem 1...to a supplementary appendix"

2. **Section 2 (Framework)**
   - Econometrica: "thorough but could be tightened"

3. **Attribution Function Discussion**
   - GEB: "attribution function specification discussion" could move to supplement
   - JET: Switching between general phi_i and linear specification without clear guidance

### Medium Priority (Single Reviewer, Strong Statement)

4. **Section 2.6.1 (Empirical Implementation)**
   - Econometrica: "raises more questions than it answers"
   - Options: streamline (demonstrate testability in principle) OR deepen (full identification strategy)

5. **Section 2.6.2 (Mind Perception Psychology)**
   - Econometrica: "perhaps excessive for Econometrica"

6. **Proposition 7 (Coordination Application)**
   - Econometrica: "thinner" than trust/public goods; "develop more fully or acknowledge that it serves primarily as an illustration"

### Lower Priority (Implicit in Concerns)

7. **Proof of Proposition 4 (Multiplicity)**
   - JET: "consists mainly of numerical examples" - could be streamlined

8. **Cross-Cultural Discussion**
   - Econometrica/JET/GEB: All mention Karpus et al. (2025) but note thin empirical base
   - Consider condensing repeated invocations

## Prioritized Action Items

### Tier 1: High Impact, Consensus Across Reviewers

| Priority | Action | Sections Affected | Est. Page Savings | Reviewers |
|----------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| 1 | Move topology details from Theorem 1 proof to supplementary appendix | Appendix A | 2-4 pages | ECTA, GEB |
| 2 | Tighten framework section (Section 2) - remove redundancy, consolidate definitions | Section 2 | 2-3 pages | ECTA |
| 3 | Move attribution function specification discussion to supplement | Section 2.4-2.5 | 1-2 pages | GEB |

### Tier 2: Medium Impact, Strengthen Paper

| Priority | Action | Sections Affected | Est. Page Savings | Reviewers |
|----------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| 4 | Streamline empirical implementation section to focus on testability | Section 2.6.1 | 1-2 pages | ECTA |
| 5 | Reduce mind perception psychology background | Section 2.6.2 | 1 page | ECTA |
| 6 | Either develop coordination application OR explicitly frame as illustration | Section 4.3 (Prop 7) | 0-1 page | ECTA |

### Tier 3: Polish Items

| Priority | Action | Sections Affected | Est. Page Savings | Reviewers |
|----------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| 7 | Add notation table (does not save pages but improves readability) | Section 2 | 0 | ECTA, GEB |
| 8 | Consolidate cross-cultural discussion | Multiple | 0.5 page | All |
| 9 | Streamline numerical examples in Proposition 4 proof | Appendix | 0.5-1 page | JET |

## Summary Metrics

- **Current length:** ~55 pages (including appendix)
- **Target reduction:** 8-12 pages (based on reviewer concerns)
- **Potential savings from Tier 1 actions:** 5-9 pages
- **Potential savings from Tier 2 actions:** 2-4 pages

## Key Insight

All three reviewers agree the paper is too long. The consensus is strongest on:
1. Moving technical proof details to a supplementary appendix (especially Theorem 1)
2. Tightening the framework section without losing essential content

The Econometrica reviewer is most detailed about specific cuts (empirical implementation, mind perception psychology). This suggests a targeted approach: reduce length while preserving the core theoretical contribution.
