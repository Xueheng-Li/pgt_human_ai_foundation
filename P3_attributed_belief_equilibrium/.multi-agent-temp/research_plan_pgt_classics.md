# Research Plan: Foundational Psychological Game Theory Literature

## Main Research Question
Extract key theoretical foundations from the foundational Psychological Game Theory papers, focusing on mathematical formalization, notation, and equilibrium concepts.

## Subtopics to Investigate

### 1. Geanakoplos, Pearce & Stacchetti (1989)
- Foundational notation for belief-dependent preferences
- Mathematical formalization of psychological games
- How expectations enter utility functions
- Sequential rationality concept
- Key equilibrium definitions

### 2. Battigalli & Dufwenberg (2009)
- Evolution from GPS framework
- Notation for higher-order beliefs
- Dynamic psychological games
- Sequential rationality with beliefs
- Modern equilibrium concepts

### 3. Comparative Analysis
- Key differences between GPS (1989) and BD (2009)
- Evolution of notation and concepts
- Standard notation for belief-dependent utilities
- Common mathematical frameworks

## Expected Information
- Formal mathematical definitions
- Key equations and utility functions
- Equilibrium concepts and their properties
- Standard notation conventions
- Theoretical innovations in each paper

## Synthesis Plan
Create comprehensive markdown document covering all theoretical foundations with proper citations and mathematical notation.
