# Research Plan: Extended Psychological Game Theory Literature on Guilt and Reciprocity

## Main Research Question
How do extended PGT papers formalize guilt/indignation mathematically, handle expectations and second-order beliefs, and relate to the foundational GPS/BD framework?

## Research Subtopics

### 1. Dufwenberg & Kirchsteiger (2004) - Sequential Reciprocity
- Mathematical formalization of kindness and reciprocity
- Intentions-based utility functions
- Sequential reciprocity mechanisms
- Relationship to GPS framework

### 2. Charness & Dufwenberg (2006) - Guilt Aversion
- Guilt aversion mathematical model
- Expectation formation and disappointment
- Partnership and promises formalization
- Connection to belief-dependent preferences

### 3. Attanasi, Battigalli & Manzoni (2016) - Incomplete Information
- Type uncertainty handling in psychological games
- Belief structures under incomplete information
- Notation for higher-order beliefs
- Extensions to GPS/BD framework

## Expected Deliverable
Comprehensive analysis saved to `phase1_pgt_extended.md` covering:
- Mathematical formalizations of guilt/indignation
- Expectations and second-order beliefs notation
- Connections to foundational GPS/BD work
- Key theoretical contributions and innovations
